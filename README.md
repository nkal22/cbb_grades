# College Basketball Attribute Grades
Grading College Basketball Players in Six Subcategories.

The calculation methodology for each score is explained below:

**Inside Scoring Grade**: Log-weighted score of rim FG% based on the total number of rim attempts. Values were then re-scaled from 0 to 100.

**Jumpshooting Grade**: Average of the log-weighted score of mid-range FG% based on the total number of mid-range attempts, and the log-weighted score of 3-PT% based on the total number of 3-point attempts. Values were then re-scaled from 0 to 100.

**Playmaking Grade**: Average of the percentile scores for AST% and AST:TO

**Rebounding Grade**: Average of the percentile scores for OREB% and DREB%

**Defense Grade**: Average of the percentile scores for STL%, BLK%, and a few defense-specific advanced metrics (DPORPAG, DBPM, DGBPM, ADRTG)
